# Advanced Image Flood Fill Engine

## Introduction

The Advanced Image Flood Fill Engine is a sophisticated C++ application designed to demonstrate the implementation and application of depth-first-search (DFS) and breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithms for dynamic image manipulation. Utilizing advanced data structures such as stacks and queues, this tool enables the application of various fill patterns and colors to images, based on pixel adjacency and color similarity.

## Features

- **Efficient Algorithm Implementation**: Incorporates optimized DFS and BFS algorithms for rapid image processing.
- **Dynamic Fill Patterns**: Supports multiple fill patterns including Stripe, Quarter, and Border, allowing for versatile image customization.
- **Advanced Data Structure Utilization**: Leverages stacks and queues to enhance algorithm performance and efficiency.
- **Modular Design**: Built with object-oriented programming principles for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes detailed test cases to ensure reliability and performance across a wide range of images.

## Demonstrations

Here are examples of the flood fill engine applied using BFS and DFS algorithms with a stripe pattern:
